### Project Summary

**Project Title:** Scala Subtyping Exercises

**Technologies Used:** Scala

**Problem Solved:**
This project involves a series of exercises focusing on subtyping and class inheritance in Scala. The primary objective is to enhance understanding of Scala's type system and object-oriented features. Key problems addressed include:

1. **Enhanced Counter Class:**
   - Extending a basic counter class to track the total number of increment and decrement operations.
   - Implementing functionality to observe the counter's behavior when passed to a function.

2. **Functional Programming:**
   - Applying higher-order functions to manipulate and observe collections of counters.
   - Ensuring correct behavior without altering existing configurations and tests.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- **Advanced Scala Programming:**
  - Gained proficiency in using Scala's class inheritance and subtyping features.
  - Learned to override methods and maintain additional state in extended classes.

- **Functional Programming Principles:**
  - Enhanced understanding of higher-order functions and their application in functional programming.
  - Improved skills in handling Scala collections (Lists and Arrays) functionally.

- **Problem-Solving and Debugging:**
  - Developed problem-solving skills by implementing and testing complex class behaviors.
  - Enhanced debugging capabilities to ensure code correctness without altering test configurations.
