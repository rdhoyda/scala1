Project Summary

Project Title: Scala Programming Exercises

Overview
This project involved completing a series of programming exercises in Scala, designed to enhance my understanding and proficiency in functional programming and Scala's core features.

Technologies Used
- Scala: A powerful language combining object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.
- SBT (Simple Build Tool): Used for compiling, testing, and packaging Scala projects.

Problem Solved
The exercises addressed various problems that required:
- Implementing functions and logic within a predefined structure.
- Ensuring code correctness and efficiency.
- Adhering to given constraints and requirements, such as not altering the SBT configuration and tests.

Key Learnings
- Functional Programming: Gained a deep understanding of functional programming concepts, including immutability, higher-order functions, and pattern matching.
- Scala Proficiency: Improved my ability to write clean, efficient, and idiomatic Scala code.
- Problem-Solving Skills: Enhanced my problem-solving skills by tackling diverse and challenging problems within the constraints provided.

Conclusion
This project significantly improved my Scala programming skills and my ability to apply functional programming principles to solve complex problems. It also strengthened my understanding of working within predefined constraints and adhering to strict guidelines.
