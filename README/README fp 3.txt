Scala Functional Programming Project
Overview
This project demonstrates the application of functional programming principles using Scala. The tasks focused on solving typical problems using recursion and immutable data structures, which are central to functional programming.

Technologies Used
Scala: The main programming language used for implementing the solutions.
SBT (Scala Build Tool): Used for project management and compilation.
Problem Solved
The project consists of several exercises that tackle different aspects of functional programming. Here are the key problems addressed:

Member Function: A recursive function to check whether an element is a member of a list without using built-in methods.
AllEqual Function: A function to determine if all elements in a list are equal, implemented recursively.
Concatenate Function: A function to concatenate a list of strings, again using recursion.
Merge Function: A recursive function to merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list.
Sum Function: A function to calculate the sum of all elements in a list, implemented without mutable variables.
Factorial Function: A classic recursive function to compute the factorial of a given number.
Key Learnings
Recursion: Gained proficiency in using recursion to solve problems, eliminating the need for loops and mutable variables.
Immutability: Learned to leverage immutable data structures, which are a cornerstone of functional programming, to write safer and more predictable code.
Pattern Matching: Utilized pattern matching extensively to simplify code and handle different cases more elegantly.
Higher-Order Functions: Developed a deeper understanding of higher-order functions and how they can be used to create more flexible and reusable code.
Pure Functions: Emphasized writing pure functions with no side effects, enhancing code reliability and testability.
Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience with key functional programming concepts in Scala. It reinforced the importance of immutability, recursion, and pure functions, laying a solid foundation for further exploration and application of functional programming paradigms in real-world scenarios
